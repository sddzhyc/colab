In contrast to before, the observed quantity in the form of the marker field $s$ cannot be changed in any way. Only the initial state of the velocity $\\mathbf{u}_0$ at $t=0$ can be modified. This gives us a split between observable quantities for the loss formulation and quantities that we can interact with during the optimization (or later on via NNs).\n",

This dimension will exist \"above\" the previous spatial dimensions `y`, `x` which are declared as dimensions for the `vector` channel. As indicated by the name `inflow_loc`, the main differences for this dimension will lie in different locations of the inflow, in order to obtain different flow simulations.

An interactive alternative would be phiflow's `view()` function, which automatically analyzes the grid content and provides UI buttons to choose different viewing modes. You can use them to show arrows, single components of the 2-dimensional velocity vectors, or their magnitudes. Because of its interactive nature, the corresponding image won't show up outside of Jupyter, though, and hence we're showing the vector length below via `plot()` instead.\n"

Thus, in line with the PINN example of {doc}`physicalloss-code` we've not really dealt with a _machine learning_ task here.
